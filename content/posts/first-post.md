## Do I need a blog here?

Probably not. 

Anyways this is probably just a note to myself or just to remind future me when I started this project. As you can see by the date of this post, I started this project on September 22, 2023. Would've been a prettier post had I start today last year. Not to mention, the so much more content I could've had. But yea, it is what it is. On a positive note, today next year (hopefully) this site will look better.
