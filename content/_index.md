# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹


## What is CSS50?

Not to confuse with Harvard University's introduction to Computer Science. This is also not a course. This is a growing collection of some useful, some beautiful CSS snippets in less than 50 lines of CSS. 



## Collaboration

CSS50 is an open source project that I started in 2023. Depending on when you read this, this project may or may not contain lots of CSS snippets. I will keep working on and building this project, but if you like the idea and you want to contribute, then feel free to tweet about this project and do a pull-request from the GitHub repository if you'd like to contribute.



## Tempora nisi nunc

Lorem **markdownum** emicat gestu. Cannis sol pressit ducta. **Est** Idaei,
tremens ausim se tutaeque, illi ulnis hausit, sed, lumina cutem. Quae avis
sequens!

    var panel = ram_design;
    if (backup + system) {
        file.readPoint = network_native;
        sidebar_engine_device(cell_tftp_raster,
                dual_login_paper.adf_vci.application_reader_design(
                graphicsNvramCdma, lpi_footer_snmp, integer_model));
    }

## Locis suis novi cum suoque decidit eadem
