## What is CSS50?

Not to confuse with Harvard University's introduction to Computer Science. This is also not a course. This is a **growing collection** of some useful, some beautiful CSS snippets in less than 50 lines of CSS that you can use in your own projects. 



## Collaboration

CSS50 is an open source project that I started in 2023. Depending on when you're reading this, this project may or may not contain lots of CSS snippets. I will keep working on and building this project in my free time. If you like the idea and you want to contribute, then feel free to share this project and/or do a pull-request from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rickyharvywaldt/CSS50).



## About the Author

My name is [Ricky Waldt](https://twitter.com/rickywaldt) and I work as project manager at [MadeIndonesia](https://madeindonesia.com). Our office is located in Yogyakarta, Indonesia where a team of designers (UI/UX, graphic, and video editors), web developers, QA, and data entry specialists work on projects for IT Companies and end customers from all over the world. By no means do I identify myself as a web developer, but I really enjoy doing little web development projects in my free time and writing about them.
