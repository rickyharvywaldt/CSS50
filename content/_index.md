## What is CSS50?

Not to confuse with Harvard University's introduction to Computer Science. This is also not a course. This is a **growing collection** of some useful, some beautiful CSS snippets in less than 50 lines of CSS that you can use in your own projects. 



## Collaboration

CSS50 is an open source project that I started in 2023. Depending on when you're reading this, this project may or may not contain lots of CSS snippets. I will keep working on and building this project, but if you like the idea and you want to contribute, then feel free to tweet about this project and do a pull-request from the GitHub repository if you'd like to contribute.
