# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹


## What is CSS50?

Not to confuse with Harvard University's introduction to Computer Science. This is also not a course. This is a **growing collection** of some useful, some beautiful CSS snippets in less than 50 lines of CSS that you can use in your own projects. 



## Collaboration

CSS50 is an open source project that I started in 2023. Depending on when you're reading this, this project may or may not contain lots of CSS snippets. I will keep working on and building this project in my free time. If you like the idea and you want to contribute, then feel free to share this project and/or do a pull-request from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rickyharvywaldt/CSS50).



## About the Author

My name is [Ricky Waldt](https://twitter.com/rickywaldt) and I work as project manager at [MadeIndonesia](https://madeindonesia.com). Our office is located in Yogyakarta, Indonesia where a team of designers (UI/UX, graphic, and video editors), web developers, QA, and data entry specialists work on projects for IT Companies and end customers from all over the world. By no means do I identify myself as a web developer, but I really enjoy doing little web development projects in my free time and writing about them.  



## Preface

You *can* have HTML without CSS, but you *cannot* have CSS without HTML. That being said, the snippets provided are only for the CSS, and unlike HTML where you don't decide the element names, you may have to adjust the CSS to fit your class names. I do provide a link for every snippet to CodePen where you can view the full code and the result. 

Finally, I won't explain the CSS line by line, unless I think it's really important to explain a specific line, as this is not a tutorial, but just a rough overview. I do however run a blog on my [other website](https://ninetynine.dev) where I mostly post beginner tutorials.
